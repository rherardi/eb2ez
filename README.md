# `eb2e.py` ‚Äî Eventbrite to EZ Badge CSV Converter

`eb2ez.py` converts an [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) **Attendee Report CSV** to an [EZ Badge](https://ez-badge.com/) **upload CSV**, enabling badge printing for in-person event attendees.

---

## üßæ Default Field Mappings

The default field mappings are tailored for the **IEEE Consultants' Network of Silicon Valley (CNSV)**, using their custom Eventbrite fields and EZ Badge upload template.

This transformation:

* Converts `Yes/No` fields into formatted values suitable for badge printing.
* Ensures EZ Badge compliance by replacing certain values and adjusting field names.
